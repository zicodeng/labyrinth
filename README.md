# Labyrinth

A simple text-based adventure game playable on the command line.

Players will be tasked with navigating a (small) labyrinth, finding a "treasure" of some kind while avoiding hazards and dangers, and successfully make it to the exit. Players will do this by typing in commands (e.g., "GO WEST") in order to explore and interact with this tiny virtual world.
